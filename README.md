# Pacman
Pacman game using olc pixel game engine and opencv


One lone coder's pixel game engine: https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine 

OpenCV 4.7.0: https://opencv.org/opencv-4-7-0/ 

I will be creating the classic pacman game using pixel game engine on a console, 
  - on a console, basic graphics classic pacman game
  - more features will be added
then adding controls via head movement using opencv
  - for that I need to detect head movement and port it to the game controls
  - more features on that will be added


This is just for fun...
